/** BaseTexture:
	This class is meant to provide a common base for all texture
	types, and help hide the integration of textures with the texture
	manager. It implements a create(..) and a free() method, which
	use the texture manager to create a new texture or free it.

	create(..) is used to create textures skipping the TextureManager::load*
		methods. It should be used to create textures that will be filled in
		by the program, or textures that should not be managed by the texture
		manager.

	free() is used to free up the resources allocated for a texture. It
		in fact reduces by one the ref counter for this texture file in the
		texture manager. If the ref counter reaches zero, the texture manager
		will free the allocated resources.
