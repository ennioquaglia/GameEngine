/**
 * ProgressManager: this class handles globally all progress indications.
 *		This makes it much easier for algorithms to refer to this global
 *		entity instead of specific controls in the environment.
 *		The general idea works as follows: we set the progress bar control
 *		that is the target and then we call the algorithm. Internally the
 *		algorithm/process uses only the static method setProgress to set the
 *		current progress. When a time-consuming sub-function has to be called,
 *		we use pushSubRange to create a new subrange (x->y). Now, the nested
 *		function will treat progressmanager as its own work is the only
 *		progress (as it goes from 0 to 100%). The progress manager will map
 *		these values to the current subrange. When the function is done,
 *		the caller calls popSubRange to remove the subrange and continue
 *		with the normal progression.
 *
 *		NOTE: progress values are in [0,1]
