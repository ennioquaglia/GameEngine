Font:
	REMOVED- the fonts fall back to using GLUT when no font is loaded. In that case,
	the output of the positions of the rendered fonts (std::vector< Rect<int> > *char_pos_out)
	doesnt work.
		solve: probably remove GLUT fallback alltogether.
	FIXED in renderStringMultiline(): handle tabs, enter
	FIXED-take care of other non-printable characters
	OK-test:are non-printable characters working for renderString()???
	FIXED: REGISTER THE POSITIONS OF NON-PRINTABLE CHARACTERS
	- support for non-cached font rendering with FreeType
		(for when a large number of very different fonts is needed)

RadioButtons:
	FIXED: when inactive, the radiobutton image appears 1px to the left
	FIXED: grouping
	
Container:
	FIXED: in mouse methods, correct the coordinates passed to the mouse*Ex methods
			to be local (subtract m_left, m_top)
	FIXED: correct the AWFUL AND ABSOLUTELY STUPID AND DISGUSTING code in mouseDown
			method, to correctly handle component z-order, without special cases
			for always-on-top - keep m_children list z-ordered!
	FIXED?(check) Wrong coordinates on click in nested containers!!!
			
Menu:
	FIXED: click works on menuitems only if it is on the item text
	FIXED: fix general structure
	fix nested submenus
	provide pop-up menus
	FIXED: provide check-able menu items
	active/inactive menu items
	
Slider:
	FIXED: HARDCODED labels!!
	-if bindValue() is called with an invalid value in the live variable,
		rendering of the Slider fails explosively. Fix!
	
Dialog:
	general structure for modal dialogs (needs revision!)
	make a dialog assembler, to easily create label-field assemblies for dialogs (most of
		the time, dialogs just have labels on the left and corresponding fields on the right)
		-SEE DialogFactory class
	
General:
	use functors instead of callbacks
	create a central class to store position of the widget images in the files
		to avoid hardcoded texture coordinates
	combine the above with a general texture manager
	add a central rendering unit to minimize texture/state changes. Keep
		dirty flags for geometry and maintain display lists
		
Component/Container:
	FIXED: ReleaseFocus does not work (it's not triggered)
	
BaseApp_Win:
	FIXED hardcoded font path!! (D:\\Windows\\Fonts\\tahoma.ttf)
	-check if tahoma.ttf can be redistributed. Find free tahoma font otherwise
	-cannot distringuish between left and right shift/ctrl, the key code is the same
	-key translation from windows codes works ok but can cause problems in the future
	-ctrl+[char] gives different key codes

TimeSeries:
	-Updater::update_all is now called from BaseApp_Win. There should be a mechanism
	for asynchronous updates, so that the new value of a variable is calculated when
	it's needed. This will get rid of a lot of redundant computations that now take place.
	
ResourceManager:
	loads resources relative to APPLICATION working dir (like ../bgui/resources/)
	
TextBox:
	-scrolling not implemented
	
EditableText:
	-create(x,y,...) takes y as the TOP coordinate??? SHOULD BE BOTTOM
	FIXED:-there are dead zones between the lines - a click there sets the cursor to the beginning of the text
	FIXED:-putting the mouse beyond the end of the line sometimes takes the cursor to the beginning
	FIXED: the cursor is not blinking - it's now FADING in and out :D
	FIXED:program crashes on enter
	-other special keys not recognised
		FIXED: home/end, ctrl+home/end
		page up/page down
	FIXED: shift+arrows etc not implemented
	-drag n drop not implemented
	-copy/paste not implemented
	-right click not implemented
	-problem with up/down in single-letter columns
	-TODO: test single-line editableText
	-create event hooks
		FIXED:-make m_text a live variable
	-make sure it's COPY-SAFE (As well as LiveVar) - SEEMS OK
	-ctrl+a not implemented
	-if user presses UP arrow when cursor is somewhere in the first line, cursor disappears (and it stays in the same place)
	-text gets selected when dragging around a window that contains a textbox (and the cursor is somewhere other 
	than the beginning of the text)
	
ListBox:
	FIXED:-when shift-selecting, the start of the selection always changes to the last clicked item
	FIXED:-in single-click multi-select, shift doesnt work
	-page up/page down dont work
	-current item not visible for key selection
	-window doesnt scroll as selection moves with arrows
	FIXED:-shift doesnt work with key selection (with space)
	-support for non-cached fonts, different for each item
		-example of use:make a font selection list
	-Ctrl+A not working, problem with key codes
	-create event hooks
	-editableText not used when rendering
	-no option to edit item text
	-shift-selection is a bit weird in multi-select-singleclick
	-deselecting after shift-selection can be troublesome in multi-select-singleclick (no way for mass-deselect of items)
	
	features:
		3 different visual styles (flat, striped, button-like)
		3 different selection modes (single selection, multiple, and multiple with single click (instead of control))
		a vertical scroller appears automatically when contents are more than the vertical size of the window
		arrows, home, end, ctrl and shift can be used to make selections using the keyboard
		disabled items appear grayed
		
ScrollBar:
	-appearance not satisfying. Redesign
	
ImageBox:
	-m_bResizeImg has an ill-defined role: it actually only stretches smaller images to fill the component's
	area, if true. There should be modes to stretch smaller-only, larger-only, all or none, and keep aspect ratio
	or not.
	
ComboBox:
	-z-order of the ListBox sub-component
	
***************URGENT!!!
	-coordinates work differently for mouseDown and mouseMove, when isPtInside is called (example: Button)!!!!!
