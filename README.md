# GameEngine
A C++ Game Engine based on OpenGL
 
Libraries and data files(models, texture, shaders, etc.) are not included yet.
I'm going to include these in the near future(hopefully), with a guide of how to install everything and make it compiler ready.
Also an explanation of how it works and how to use it is in the todo-list.
A level editor(almost ready) too. 

Libraries used:
-opengl/glu/glew
-glfw3  - context creation
-glm    - math library
-assimp - model importing
-SOIL   - texture loading
-bullet - physics library
-pugixml- xml parsing

Featuring:
-System/Entity/Component logic model
-Physics Engine(bullet)
-Skeletal Mesh, with animations
-Post Processing 
-Shaders support
